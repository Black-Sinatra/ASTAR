# Data-driven Modeling of Mobility in Scotland

Welcome to the Data-driven Modeling of Mobility in Scotland project, an exploration of shortest path algorithms for public transport schedules in Scotland. In this Java project, we implement the A* algorithm to find efficient routes, compare it to Dijkstra's algorithm, and develop a software program to convert ATCO-CIF files to GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) format.

## Project Overview

In this Java project, we focus on optimizing public transport route planning in Scotland. We utilize the A* algorithm, a widely-used pathfinding algorithm, to determine the most efficient routes. Additionally, we compare the A* algorithm's performance to Dijkstra's algorithm to assess their suitability for the task.

## Prerequisites

To run this Java project and contribute to its development, you need the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your system.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java.
- Familiarity with public transport schedule data, ATCO-CIF files, and GTFS format.

## Project Features

Key features of this Java project include:

- Implementation of the A* algorithm for efficient route planning.
- A comparative analysis of the A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Development of a software program to convert ATCO-CIF files to GTFS format, making public transport data more accessible and usable.

## Algorithm Comparison

We conduct a comparison of the A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm to evaluate their performance, accuracy, and suitability for route planning in public transport schedules. The comparison results are documented in our project.

## ATCO-CIF to GTFS Converter

To enhance the usability of public transport data, we've developed a Java software program that converts ATCO-CIF files, a common data format in the UK, to the GTFS format. This converter facilitates the integration of public transport data into various applications and platforms.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `AStarAlgorithm.java`: Implementation of the A* algorithm in Java.
